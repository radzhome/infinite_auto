  <h1 class="mb-12">Buying a 3-row SUV - A Buyers Help Guide</h1>
  <p>Published 05/25/2024</p>
  <p>By Radek Wojcik</p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="https://images.cars.com/cldstatic/wp-content/uploads/three-row-suv-challenge-2019-group-shot-01.jpg" alt="3-Row SUVs">
  <div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">The rational of purchasing a 3-Row SUV</h2>
    <p> Lets be honest here, nobody is purchasing a 3-Row to save on gas, or for the on track performance aspects. Or
        with the green alarmism going around, to save the planet. This is mainly reserved for large families typically
        with two or more kids or the grandparents that haul them around. What you get is at least seating for 6, plenty
        of cargo and tow capacity, and a increased ride height. These vehicles can get massive and hard to park! Lets face
        it the days of the minivan are long and gone. Even though these vehicles offer more space, better fuel economy and
        sliding doors, nobody is buying them because of the looks. Just look at the 2024 Kia Carnival, its a van trying
        to look like a SUV. You don't have SUVs trying to look like vans. For some customers the ride height when going
        off road a little bit for some crown land camping is also important, and that scenario includes tow capacity
        which SUVs usually rate higher for vs a van. The status that comes with a SUV is also higher than that of a van
        so that can be a factor. Lets examine some of the top contenders across the spectrum of 3-rows that I have
        the chance to examine.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Mazda CX-9</h2>
    <p> Mazda has been very successful as of late by capturing customers with their premium materials, look and feel and
        the Kodo design language which captures motion at a stand still. You get a premium vehicle with the looks and
        handling but without the performance or poor reliability and high maintenance cost of a german premium vehicle.
        With the CX-9 you get a descent package and now that the vehicle reached end of life at least in Canada you get
        a more reliable vehicle as all the kinks such as the head gasket engine failures of 2016 model year were worked
        out. That is the beauty of buying a vehicle that has matured and you are purchasing one of its latest model years.
    </p>
      <p>
          The CX-9 has now been replaced with the bigger and more elegant CX-90. When mazda announced this anticipated
          vehicle it was a vehicle like no other with a inline 6 cylinder and rear wheel drive. Many said that Mazda
          is building a BMW. The fact of the matter is the CX-90 comes with a very complicated powertrain which
          if mazda just gave us a standard inline 6 cylinder version, their sales would be higher. Customers are still
          not willing to compromise getting a MHEV due to the reliability aspect and higher repair costs. This is also
          a new platform and a new powertrain so if Mazda kept it simple it may have been an easier choice. The car is
          bigger and does not handle like the CX-9 which translates in less fun to drive. The first gen CX-9 with
          its massive 3.8l V6 but instead a more refined inline 6 is what people were looking for. The first gen CX-9
          did not do so well while mazda was still working with ford. The car did prove to be somewhat reliable however.
      </p>
      <p>
          Going back to the CX-9 you get an older, proven car. You get one of the better fuel economies in its class.
          A 250hp turbo inline 4 2.5L which gives you about 227hp when using regular 87 octane fuel. The car is massive
          its very long and wide compared to the interior space you get. Its about 6.5cm longer than the huge Kia Telluride
          and even more so than the Hyundai Pallisade even though these cars offer more interior room. You also don't get
          8 seats, but a max of 7 and if you want to get the top Kuro and Signature models you go down to only 6 seats
          which is not at all what a family hauler is for. Captians chairs in the 2nd row seem like something for a
          business man not a family, not sure what mazda was thinking with not offering 7 or even 8 seats in this
          vehicle in the top trims. This would still be my top overall pick but unfortunately I would have to find the
          most top optioned 7 seater. If there was an 8 seater offering at even a lower trim I would be willing to
          have sacrificed that but unfortunately 7 is all you get.
      </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Toyota Highlander</h2>
    <p>
      The Highlander and the new Grand Highlander are also on my list because Toyota has the best reliability and resale
        values on the market. The thing I like about the highlander, at least the older model year like the 2023 is that
        you get a 3.5L naturally aspirated reliable engine. The new cars are all 4 cylinder turbos which might be the
        most reliable turbos on the market but anything turbo wont be as reliable. Also there is no replacement for displacement
        when it comes to real raw power and towing capacity.
    </p>
      <p>
          The 2023 highlander has a few downsides however. Yes you can get the 3.5L v6 which if you get a cx9 you get
          a lower towing 2.5L turbo. But the problem with the highlander is that its a souleless car with cheap finishes
          even in the higher trims. It just does't have a premium look or feel to it. I can live with that but then you add
          the higher insurance costs because these things get stolen like hot cakes. So sure you can take precautions and
          put your key fobs away in a bullet proof case but you are still gonna pay the higher insurance regardless.
          And unless you are planning to sell the higher resale value isn't going to get you far.
      </p>
      <p>
          This is the vehicle my parents have purchased and have not had it stolen every (yet). The car has been a
          perfect choice with no frills but plenty of cargo space and towing capacity of 5000 lbs (cx9 is only 3500lbs).
          This is also a car that you know you can rely on and beat up a little. And even with the ocassional ding you
          wont really cry over it as the car isn't designed to be a looker anyways. This is a great no-frills added,
          toyota reliablity choice.
      </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Ford Explorer, Lincoln Aviator</h2>
    <p>
      When looking at these vehicles, I was mainly interested in a used Lincoln Aviator. You can purchase a several year
        old Aviator Reserve trim that had a price tag of over 90k now for under 40k, about the cost of a 1 year old cx-9.
        This car is absolutely beautiful and luxurious. But it suffers in reliability as the super low resale value
        projects, this car has some problems. You can find it on the most unreliable cars lists if you search. It also
        has a 3.0L ecoboost with unpredictable reliability. If I was ok with always fixing this vehicle it would of
        been my top choice. Unfortunately for me, having a vehicle that you don't have to fix all the time is more important.
    </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Mitsubishi Outlander</h2>
    <p>
      Although I would never have considered this for my family because its way too small. The thing offers 7 seats
        in such a compact design, the car is about the size of a Cx-5 but offers a 3rd row. The upper trim is also
        nicely equipped with every luxury you want inside the cabin. The car is underpowered offering a 181hp engine
        standard and the PHEV offers 248hp. Its a great budget 3 row.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Jeep Grand Cherokee, Cherokee L</h2>
    <p>
      I found some appeal here with the Grand Cherokee L extended model which offers about a foot extra of room
        in overall length.
    </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Honda Pilot, Acura MDX</h2>

    <p>
      Although I would never have considered this for my family
    </p>
